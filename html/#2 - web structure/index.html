                <h2>Achi Baba</h2>
                Achi Baba is a maze of desert canyons with tall vegetation and rocky terrain, lying a short way inland on the coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula. On the east side, numerous high stone cliffs form hard choke points in the fractured ground between them. The west side is more open, with dry creek beds running across the parched, sandy plains and craggy hills. Midway between the British outpost and Ottoman batteries are ancient ruins. Most other constructions in the area are quickly-prepared coverings for storage, and entrenched fortifications, save for some houses close to the town of Krithia on the north side of the map. From south to north, the map gradually slopes upwards.
